Bug/Map Fixing

Initially a lot of the feedback for the gameplay of the map was cutoff,
This was due to the walls having missing physic properties for a few areas (all of which were fixed afer the greybox testing)
from there the theme wasn't too known, Nor was the actual flow of the map the best
There were issues such as the map being too big for 4 players and areas that cut off and didn't allow free movement
So how I solved this issue was with how I placed the weapons and additions. Although the map size increased
Beyond what it was before I added weapons and objects in keypoints that I wanted players to go to, This way players not finding one another
Wouldn't be as big of an issue while keeping the base design and feel of the map in tact.
I designed the map for larger groups of players in mind so I wanted to keep that as somehting that stayed.

Details added- - 
The texturing was abel to help the theme be conveyed to a point
I furthered it through added a few walls in places which scaled above the actual map walls (All of which are inexcessable to players)
as well as an overarching tower that looks like it belongs to a castle. This way it didn't intrdude on the initial design
yet it kept the feel of each area and what I wanted them to represent.
