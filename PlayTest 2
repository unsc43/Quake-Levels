# Texturing <h1> Immersion and Theme

First and foremost I wanted to immerse players through the texturing with giving a dark medievial esc vibe, With that I tried using a lot of stone brick looks
Other materials that seemed to fit more in the medevial look as well, At the same time I also gave it some fantasy aspects to still connect to the doom vibe,
with glowing pillars and lava lighting a section of an area.

The texturing of the glow allows players to feel as if there is something more to the map rather than just simple buildings and bricks everywhere while a lack of metalic
or futuristic styled building textures give more of an old medevial castle tone.
